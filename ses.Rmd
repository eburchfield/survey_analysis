#R notebook - script and pull out R markdown from script

# Data Notes

There are 318 farmers across 6 communities:

```{r}
source("ses.R")
table(GN)
#call function 
plot()
#cache = TRUE
#purl <- Rmarkdown into script
```



```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
